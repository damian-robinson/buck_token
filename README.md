# SMPL Token
### A cryptocurrency pegged to the most valuable commodity: time.
---

## Introduction
Currencies today are backed by commodities and trust. Commodity-backed currencies fluctuate in value due to economic factors. Trust-backed currencies fluctuate in value due to changing confidence in economic factors. These fluctuations are one of the core problems of currency. SMPL token aims to eliminate these kinds of economy-induced value fluctuations by pegging currency to time.

## Why Time
Time is the most valuable, non-physical commodity we have, because it's 100% coupled to how we exert our life energies. Furthermore, the units of time don't change. One minute equals sixty seconds. There is no inherent fluctation. Therefore, one minute for each person has a non-fluctating base value for every person. With SMPL token, value is based on the minute, and each individual decides their own value for any service rendered (work) at any given time for any agreement (contract) they make. This puts our time/energy value in our own hands. We name our price. Supply, demand, and our skill level in rendering our services (using our time & energy) will determine our unique value in contrast to every other individual in an industry (society).
